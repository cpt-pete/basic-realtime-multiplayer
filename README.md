# Basic Realtime Multiplayer in NodeJS and browser

This project is based an excellent article by Sven Bergstr√∂m : [Real Time Multiplayer in HTML5](http://buildnewgames.com/real-time-multiplayer/).

I've taken some of the source provided and simplified it.  The aim being to improve my understanding of how proper multiplayer games work.

It represents a persistant world where clients can join / log off at any point.  Supports more than 2 players (hardcoded to 3 but could be any number).
